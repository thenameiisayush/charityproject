# **Charity Blockchain Platform**

## **Problem Statement**
Charities often struggle with security and accessibility in financial transactions. The major challenges include:
- Lack of a dedicated platform ensuring security and transparency.
- Absence of a mechanism that allows people to exercise their Right to Information and verify expenditure records.
- Existing solutions are either inaccessible to smaller organizations or lack a user-friendly interface.

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages **blockchain technology** to create a **secure, transparent, and accessible platform** for charities. By integrating smart contracts, organizations can ensure verifiable and immutable transaction records.

## **Technology Stack**
### **1. Solidity & Web3**
- Implements smart contracts with **multiple-level inheritance** features.
- Facilitates secure and transparent transactions.

### **2. MetaMask**
- Enables users to connect and manage transactions seamlessly through a **secure wallet service**.

### **3. Node.js**
- Serves as the **backend**, handling transaction records and communication between the frontend and blockchain.

### **4. Ganache**
- Provides a **local Ethereum blockchain** environment to deploy and test contracts before production.

## **How It Works**
1. Users must connect to **MetaMask** for authentication and transactions.
2. A **Ganache RPC server** is launched, with MetaMask acting as the wallet.
3. Organization and charity details are **stored in the application** with a **generated hash value**.
4. Transactions are executed between organizations and charities, generating a unique **transaction hash**.
5. Once all transactions are mined, a **new block is added** to the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
